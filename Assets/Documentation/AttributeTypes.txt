Introduce Attribute Types (old Types get replaced and logic dependent on old type will be moved to attribute child classes):

Base Attributes
	- Constant, Value is set at creation of the attribute and will NEVER change
	- Value is not directly used for any in-game mechanic, but rather influences other attributes that do
	- i.e. Base Land Movement Speed, Base Nutrient Value

Helper Attributes
	- Fixed values, not dymanically calculated
	- can change after creation
	- Value is not directly used for any in-game mechanic, but rather influences other attributes that do
	- i.e. Age, Pregnancy Progress

Intermediary Attributes
	- percentage value with a base value of 1 (100%)	 
	- Value is dynamically calculated from other attributes and/or Status Effects, NO base value
	- Value is not directly used for any in-game mechanic, but rather influences other attributes that do

	- i.e. Maturity, Size, Motorics, Hunger, Fertility

Stat Attributes
	- Attributes that are directly used for an in-game mechanic
	- usually calculated from base attributes, intermediary attributes and/or status effects
	- i.e. Land Movement Speed, Hunger Rate
