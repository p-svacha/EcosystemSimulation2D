# General

Every creature is a collection of genes and nothing else.

Phenotype and genotype are both set by the same genetics system.
This means two creatures with the exact same genetic makeup will always look the same, have the same stats and act the same.
Every gene can (but doesn't have to) affect the creatures looks, stats and behavioural logic.
The goal is that genes always influence both the looks and logic/stats, so that a creatures behaviour can be broadly read solely by looking at it.


# Genes
Each gene has the following attributes:
 Id: Unique identifier for that specific gene
 Category: An identifier to group genes. The category is used to decide if it can be attached to another gene or not.
 Effect: The effect the gene has on the looks, stats and behaviour of the creature.

 Required gene categories: A list of categories which need to have at least 1 gene. They can also have multiple but only 1 will be dominant/expressed - all can be inherited tho. 
                      Usually used for mutually exclusive behaviour types.
                      Initial (wild) species will usually only have 1 gene per required category.

 Optional gene categories: A list of categories which can have 0-n genes. Only 1 will be dominant/expressed but all can be inherited tho. 

 Modifier gene categories: 0-n genes of these categories can be present and all of them are expressed. Usually used for stat modifiers.

A gene should additionally contain easy to get info regarding.
Does it change looks / behaviours / stats? (3 bools)



# Root Genes

Every creature has exactly one root gene which makes up the base of the creature.
Creatures are only able to reproduce with species of the same root gene.
Root genes are there to have certain "creature classes" that are distinct by nature but can still have very different subspecies within them.

Examples for root genes and some possible subspecies are:
 Hoofed     -   Elk, Deer, Cow, Sheep, Horse (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even-toed_ungulate)
 Weasel     -   Raccoon, Squirrel, Skunk
 Dog        -   Fox, Wolf
 Cat        -   House cat, tiger, hyena
 Fish
 Insect

 Root genes affect:
        - Which gene categories the animal must/can have
        - Which body parts the animal must/can have. 


# Gene Examples

## Hoofed Root Gene
Category: Root
Effect: Gives a specific look, base stats and behaviour tree to the creature.
        4 Legs, alive children, lungs, eat grass, hoofes (can walk any terrain), can't fly/climb
Required gene categories: Hoofed body type, Hoofed head shape, Size, Neck type, Group behaviour, Hoof surface specialization
Optional gene categories: Head gear
Modifier gene categories: General modifiers, Hoofed modifiers
