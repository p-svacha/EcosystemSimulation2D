added general movement modifier
added main attributes to animal selection window

UP NEXT
-------------
- rework attribute types (see attributetypes.txt)
- add second animal
- Animals should drink water and have Thirst
- Add mountains
- add multiple sprite support for objects (tall grass)
- rename Animal to AnimalBase
- plants should have slow health regeneration
- add berries
- Add wofox animal
- add selection marker when something is selected (add spriterenderer as child and scale it)
- use raycast in RemoveObject tool in editor to exactly remove the object you're aiming at
- add tooltips to statusdisplays in selectionwindow (statuseffect descirption)
- add tooltips to bars in selectionwindow (attribute descirption)
- add particle effect when eating
- add path visualization to show where animals are walking to atm
- status effects on animals
- draw ordering layer for tileobjects
- thinginfo window:
	- display floats with only one decimal
	- max height
	- make categories collapsable
	- two tabs (sorted by category, sorted by type (with new type system))
- create TilemapTileObject class that supports health and basic functions without needing to be visible on the map (used later for walls/cliffs)
	- update tileobjectfactory
- add speed4 button with modifier 10
- add statusdisplay displays in SelectionWindow for Animals
- control simulation speed with space 0/1/2/3/4 keys
- editor: rightclick removes active tool
- add scrollbar to thinginfo window with maxlength
- split thingId into Animal, Plant etc. and make editorwindow dynamically sort into categories
- add shoreeggs, eggs that spawn in water on shore
- add wofox - woolfox that eats shoreeggs but is afraid of water, they produce wool
- add carrier animal that brings shoreggs to wofoxes and eat wool
- add herbivour bears that eat everything
- add drowning when an animal that cant swim is in water

		- newborn and event spawn have different effects for example
- change selection window focus button to fastly move to target instead of instant jump
- add mouseover for statusdisplays in selectionwindow that show modifiers
- sound
- improve world generation to spawn plants with age and also animals with age

IDEAS FOR PERFORMANCE INCREASES
------------------------
- Don't process every entity each frame.
- Split processing into stuff that needs doing often and stuff that does not need doing often.
	- for example don't call UpdateDeath every tick. I've tried and it works!!
- Spread long-running algorithms across multiple frames so that they don't block processing in other systems.
- Ensure that efficient algorithms and data structures are used.
- Cache the results of expensive calculations if they are likely to be used again.
