SINCE LAST COMMIT
-------------------


UP NEXT
-------------
- add life expectancy death of old age
	- add lifeexpectancy of plants
	- decrease grass spawn rate
	- make world generation spawn with some grass
 ==> check performance

- add second animal
- Animals should drink water and have Thirst
- Add mountains
- add multiple sprite support for objects (tall grass)
- rename Animal to AnimalBase
- add plantsBase class between VisibleTileObject and TallGrass
- plants should spawn with 1 health
- plants should have slow health regeneration
- plants scale size with health
- add berries
- Add wofox animal
- add selection marker when something is selected (add spriterenderer as child and scale it)
- use raycast in RemoveObject tool in editor to exactly remove the object you're aiming at
- add tooltips to statusdisplays in selectionwindow
- add tooltips for buttons in selectionwindow
- add particle effect when eating
- add path visualization to show where animals are walking to atm
- status effects on animals
- draw ordering layer for tileobjects
- thinginfo window:
	- display floats with only one decimal
	- max height
	- make categories collapsable
- create TilemapTileObject class that supports health and basic functions without needing to be visible on the map (used later for walls/cliffs)
	- update tileobjectfactory
- add speed4 button with modifier 10
- add statusdisplay displays in SelectionWindow for Animals
- control simulation speed with space 0/1/2/3/4 keys
- editor: rightclick removes active tool
- add scrollbar to thinginfo window with maxlength
- split thingId into Animal, Plant etc. and make editorwindow dynamically sort into categories
- add shoreeggs, eggs that spawn in water on shore
- add wofox - woolfox that eats shoreeggs but is afraid of water, they produce wool
- add carrier animal that brings shoreggs to wofoxes and eat wool
- add herbivour bears that eat everything
- add drowning when an animal that cant swim is in water
- add eventframework:
	- eventmanager that can trigger random events
	- events that do something when triggered
- add "animals wander in" event
- dynamic attribute pregnancy chance based on age, health, etc.
- dynamic attribute miscarriagechance to all animals
	- add miscarriages
- allow creating objects with certain values already set
	- maybe make a virtual OnSpawn function for TileObject that sets desired attributes for newly spawned objects
	- TileFactory would call that function
	- additionally params can added to TileFactory.CreateObject that get passed on to OnSpawn, necessary to know where the spawning is from
		- newborn and event spawn have different effects for example
- fix display of HourSplit in SimulationTime.ToString so it always just shows ".#"
- change selection window focus button to fastly move to target instead of instant jump
- add mouseover for statusdisplays in selectionwindow that show modifiers
- sound

IDEAS FOR PERFORMANCE INCREASES
------------------------
- Don't process every entity each frame.
- Split processing into stuff that needs doing often and stuff that does not need doing often.
	- for example don't call UpdateDeath every tick. I've tried and it works!!
- Spread long-running algorithms across multiple frames so that they don't block processing in other systems.
- Ensure that efficient algorithms and data structures are used.
- Cache the results of expensive calculations if they are likely to be used again.
