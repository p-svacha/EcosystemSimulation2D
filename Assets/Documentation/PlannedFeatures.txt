IDEAS FOR PERFORMANCE INCREASES
------------------------
- Don't process every entity each frame.
- Split processing into stuff that needs doing often and stuff that does not need doing often.
	- for example don't call UpdateDeath every tick. I've tried and it works!!
- Spread long-running algorithms across multiple frames so that they don't block processing in other systems.
- Ensure that efficient algorithms and data structures are used.
- Cache the results of expensive calculations if they are likely to be used again.
